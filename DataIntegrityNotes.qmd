# Introduction Tutorial Approach

While there are lots of "big use-cases", e.g., drivers licenses, passports, etc., this presentation will look at a smaller and more enjoyable use case of a school or community club that can utilize digital credentials in a useful way.

* [Verifiable credential WG documents](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/publications/)
* [Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/credentials/)

## TODOs and Ideas

* What kind of DID to use? For the club. Do we need one for the member? I don't think so.
* Other contexts that could be used "open badges", "CLR"... but we are rolling our own
* Choosing a cryptosuite. Decision tree.


## A College/Community Club

A college/community club with a website, loaner equipment for members, events (open to all, open only to members, members paid, etc.), rating system, dues, etc. An example of such a club is the [Cal Sailing Club](https://www.cal-sailing.org/) a university club that morphed into a community club. This *club* will be the [issuer](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#issuer) and the *member* will be the [credential subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#credential-subject). The *club* will also be the prime verifier.

Grants credentials... Verifies credentials. One big credential or multiple smaller credentials?

Locations where equipment may be borrowed may have limited connectivity. Also don't want to "phone home" or necessarily track members, except "who broke it" last use type of information... or "exessive use" information.

Can we do better than an easily forgeable paper/plastic card? **Yes**

* Membership credential issuance
  * Prerequisites: Basic Member information, Emergency Contact, Liability wavers, Dues Paid
  * Membership credential issued. Dues payment may set the VC's *validFrom* and *validUntil* properties. See [Validity Period](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#validity-period)
* Competency Rating credential issuance
  * These may have a different validity period, may be honored by other affiliated clubs...
  * Dock etiquet
  * Equipment setup and take down
  * Water (tides and currents) and wind conditions knowledge
  * Wind based Skill Levels
  * Instructor Skill Levels
* Equipment checkout verification
  * Compentency certificate
  * Dues currently paid
  * Previously borrowed equipment returned

Can we show workflows? Issue an example credential into a wallet?

* Credential Specification
  * Developing the "context", standard and custom parts **Will Show**
  * A single big credential or multiple credentials?
* Credential Creation and Data Integrity **Will Show**
  * Credential creation without `proof`
  * Data Integrity: a general signature mechanism that works with **any** cryptographic signature scheme.
  * Signature cryptosuite selection **A slide or two**
  * This is initiated by a member and authorized by appropriate club "officers". This would be a club specific workflow which could utilize a call to the VC API to sign a credential.
* Credential Issuance
  * Can we make our own website issue a credential into a wallet? *Issue here is wallets that work with VCs* I didn't see any simple VC wallets for Android. **Will not show**
  * What is this protocol stack? What wallets? [Info on CHAPI](https://vcplayground.org/docs/)
* Credential Verification
  * In person verification when taking a competency exam
  * In person verification when checking out/returning equipment
  * Automated "locker" access for gear checkout/return

# Club Credential Specification

See file `/home/greg/Greg_Work/SecurityPrivacy/JSONLD-Test/FoilingCreds.md` for content ideas.

VC Data Model 2.0 [@VC-DM2.0] -- "This specification uses JSON-LD 1.1 to serialize the data model",


Choices: *embedded proof* (Data Integrity 1.0) or *enveloping proof*

, JSON and JSON-LD, Contexts

**Question**: How best to organize the credentials for the club? Assuming a multi-sport wind sport club, e.g., sailing, windsurfing, windsurf foiling, wing foiling. Should we have one credential with lots of properties, or lots of separate credentials, or something in between, e.g., membership credential and sport specific credentials?

1. Membership: are their dues currently paid. Natural expiration date, covered by dues period. This would tend to be a much shorter period of time than for knowledge or skill expiration.
2. Knowledge competency (written):
   1. General Knowledge: Dock etiquet, Tides and Currents, Wind conditions, Boundaries for skill levels. Note: dock etiquet (shared use of docks) can change if some docks are out of service. Youth classes are being held, etc... The others would tend not to change much over time.
   2. Sport and Equipment Specific Knowlege (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced)
      1. Sailing: Hoist usage, rigging of specific boat types.
      2. Windsurfing: equipment familiarity (terminology), board set up. Rigging
      3. Windsurf foiling: equipment familiarity, foil setup, rigging
      4. Wing foiling: equipment familiarity, foil setup, wing setup and care.
   3. Sport Specific Skills
      1. Dinghy sailing: Junior Skipper (Docking, tacking, jibing, man-over-board, capsize and recovery)
      2. Windsurfing: Beginner (board paddling to return to dock), Junior: Sail in 10mph or less wind around buoy X in cove and return to dock; Intermediate: sail in 10-15mph wind around buoy Y and return; Advanced: Sail in 15-25mph wind around buoy Z and return.
      3. Windsurf foiling: must be *advanced* windsurfer. Intermediate sustained foiling for 30 seconds or more. Advanced: demonstrate successful foiling jibe.
      4. Wing foiling: etc...

## JSON Everywhere

My Notes: When teaching "web developement" to CS majors there is so much material to be covered need to reduce the cognitive load. I would choose to use JavaScript on the server since students would need to learn JavaScript for the browser. JavaScript contains an easy to use subset that can be used to express nearly arbitrary data structures. This is JSON.

* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) Simple, easy, data interoperability, across many languages. Data "lingua franca" for the web. I would teach this early (week 4) on in a first web dev class for CS majors [JSON Slides](https://www.grotto-networking.com/WebsiteDevelopment/files/lectures/Misc/JSON.html#/title-slide).
* [JSON-Schema](https://json-schema.org/) "JSON Schema is a declarative language for annotating and validating JSON documents' structure, constraints, and data types." Would teach this in a second web development course for use in data validation. [JSON-Schema Slides](https://www.grotto-networking.com/WebsiteDevelopment/files/lectures/Misc/JSON-Schema.html)  Would have my students use [npm: AJV](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv). I use AJV for initial credential validation in my [VC interoperability test server](https://github.com/Wind4Greg/Server-for-VCs)
* [RFC6901 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901),April 2013, "JSON Pointer defines a string syntax for identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document.", Only 8 pages.
* [RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785), June 2020. "Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing need the data to be expressed in an invariant format so that the operations are reliably repeatable. One way to address this is to create a canonical representation of the data."

Example: Popularity of JSON-Schema and AJV

## JSON-LD (What Does it Add?)

JSON-LD 1.1 [@JSON-LD-1.1] Abstract: "JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format. This specification defines JSON-LD 1.1, a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines."

"In addition to all the features JSON provides, JSON-LD introduces:"

* a universal identifier mechanism for JSON objects via the use of IRIs,
* a way to disambiguate keys shared among different JSON documents by mapping them to IRIs via a **context**,
* a mechanism in which a value in a JSON object may refer to a resource on a different site on the Web,
* the ability to annotate strings with their language,
* a way to associate datatypes with values such as dates and times,
* and a facility to express one or more directed graphs, such as a social network, in a single document.

**Question**: Which of these are used in VCs? How are these different from JSON-Schema capabilities?

RDF Canonicalization [@RDF-Canon]

**Abstract**:  "RDF [RDF11-CONCEPTS] describes a graph-based data model for making claims about the world and provides the foundation for reasoning upon that graph of information. At times, it becomes necessary to compare the differences between sets of graphs, digitally sign them, or generate short identifiers for graphs via hashing algorithms. This document outlines an algorithm for normalizing RDF datasets such that these operations can be performed."

**Why?** Selective Disclosure!!! Want an ordered set of statements that can be selectively revealed. Need the additional algorithms from selective disclosure portion of ECDSA-SD spec.

## Basic VC Data Model 2.0 VC

The minimal example from VC DM 2.0:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2", // Includes DataIntegrityProof
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "MyPrototypeCredential"],
  "credentialSubject": {
    "mySubjectProperty": "mySubjectValue"
  }
}
```

Useful additional fields from VC DM 2.0:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.mysailclub.org/ns/credentials" // Our context here
  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/58473", // id of the VC
  "name": "The name of this credential",
  "description": "A description of the credential",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "WaterClubCredential"],
  "issuer": { // Specify the issuer nicely
    "id": "https://mysailclub.org", // club IRI (but also URL)
    "name": "My Wind Sports Club", // issuer name
    "description": "A public or school based wind sports club." // issuer desc
  },
  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "validUntil": "2020-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21", // id of the subject
    // Here is where all the custom stuff will go
  }
}
```

### Data Integrity 1.0 *proof*

A summary of the ***proof*** field from data integrity 1.0 document is given below. The *proof* field object without the *proofValue* entry is used as the "proof options" is used as the input to many of the cryptosuites.

```javascript
{
  // required fields
  "type": "DataIntegrityProof", // Only. We are using the DI 1.0 spec
  "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod", // Use this value for VCs
  "cryptosuite": "One of official cryptosuite names", // We will discuss how to pick
  "verificationMethod": "points to issuer public key, either did:key or ",
  "proofValue": "Cryptographic value computed by the cryptosuite",
  // optional fields
  "created": "", // applies to proof not credential
  "expires": "", // applies to proof
  "id": "", // id of the proof
  "domain": "we will not use",
  "challenge": "we will not use",
  "previousProof": "we will not use", // for proof sets or chains
  "nonce": "we will not use"
}

```

For the *verificationMethod* we use a DID to map to the issuers public key. There are many "DID methods" from the point of view of our club which is has a web site implementation we will consider using "did:key", "did:web", and "did:webvh".

* [DID Methods: Known DID Methods in the Decentralized Identifier Ecosystem](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-extensions-methods/)
* [The did:key Method v0.7](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-key-spec/) Use for development easy to pass around the public key for the cryptosuite.
* [did:web Method Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) Use for deployment since club already has a website.
* [The did:webvh DID Method v1.0](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v1.0/) More features than "did:web" can use for deployment since club already has a website.
* Current possible values for the *cryptosuite* field: "ecdsa-sd-2023", "bbs-2023", "ecdsa-jcs-2019", "ecdsa-rdfc-2019", "eddsa-jcs-2022", and "eddsa-rdfc-2022".


## Context Creation

Example from ECDSA-SD test vectors:

```javascript
// context for "https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#"

export const windSDexamples = {
  '@context': {
    '@protected': true,
    year: 'https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#year',
    boardName: 'https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#boardName',
    sailName: 'https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#sailName',
    size: 'https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#size',
    brand: 'https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#brand',
    boards: 'https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#boards',
    sails: 'https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#sails',
    sailNumber: 'https://windsurf.grotto-networking/selective#sailNumber'
  }
}
```

The credentials for our club will be broken down into three groups:

* member status (dues paid, etc...), [alumni example](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#example-use-of-the-context-property)
* knowledge certifications: a set of specific knowledge demonstrated
* skill certifications: a set of specific skills demonstrated

Complete specifications in the education area: [Open Badges Overview](https://www.1edtech.org/standards/open-badges), [Open Badges Specification Spec Version 3.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/)-- based on VC DM 2.0 --  and [Comprehensive Learner Record Standard Spec Version 2.0 ](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/clr/v2p0) this features a list of "achievements".

Note that the CLR 2.0 *context* uses `"@container": "@set"` for its `achievement` field, i.e., multiple "achievements" while in Open Badges 3.0 you get one acheivement.

## Signing Credentials via Data Integrity

**Which cryptosuite and why?**

## Transfer to Holder via CHAPI

### Wallets and Such

Although there are tons of crypto wallets out there, there doesn't seem to be many general purpose wallets for credentials. Most have virtually no documentation about what standards they implement for transfer or credential format. A few with some info are listed below.

* [Veres Wallet](https://demo.vereswallet.dev/) "Stores any credential that can be stored in a physical wallet. Cloud-based digital wallet that cannot be lost or stolen. Access your credentials from all of your devices"
* [Learner Credential Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.lcw) "Learner Credential Wallet is a cross-platform mobile application for storing and sharing digital learner credentials as specified in the learner credential wallet specification developed by the Digital Credentials Consortium. The learner credential wallet specification is based on the draft W3C Universal Wallet interoperability specification and the draft W3C Verifiable Credentials data model."
* [CA DMV Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.ca.dmv.wallet) Specific to CA DMV.

Specifications and such:

* [CCG: Universal Wallet 2020](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/) "This specification describes a portable, extensible, JSON-LD wallet representation, supporting digital currencies and credentials." Last updated 2023.
* [OpenWallet Foundation](https://openwallet.foundation/)
