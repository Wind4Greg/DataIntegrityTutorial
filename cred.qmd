* **WindPatterns**: Know the common wind directions and patterns. Know what a "fade" is. Know what "banding" is and why its not a good thing. Never go out in easterlies!
* **LandMarksBuoys**: Know the common landmarks and buoys so you can communicate effectively with your fellow sailors.
* **BigBoatsFerries**: Let's stay alive people! Know the "big boat" traffic lanes in the bay. Know that they cannot stop (well yes, they can in a mile or two!). Know the fast ferry routes and why you always need to pay attention when crossing (yes, they are really fast).

### knowledgeDate {#knowledgeDate}

When was this knowledge *last* demonstrated, i.e., tested.

## skills {#skills}

### skillDate {#skillDate}

## distanceAchievements {#distanceAcheivements}

Some of our members like to go for long distance sailing sessions. Making ones way to various landmarks and buoys in the bay is an acheivement and point of pride. The *distanceAchievement* set captures these. All are referenced from a starting point of either Berkeley south basin or the Berkeley Yacht Club.

### landmark {#landmark}

*landmark* is a single string denoting the "thing" that was visited or rounded. This uses very location specific jargon as mentioned below:

* Common buoy names/abbreviations "R2", "R4", "BlossomRock", "HardingRock"
* Common landmark names: "TI" (Treasure Island), "Alcatraz", "Crissy" (Crissy Field beach, San Francisco), "ClipperCove" (Cove in Treasure Island where in olden times Pan Am clipper planes were berthed).
* Strange club names: "BridgeRun" denotes a trip from Berkeley all the way up and under the Golden Gate Bridge and back. This is not really a "run", since one is working their way up wind all the way to the Golden Gate bridge.
