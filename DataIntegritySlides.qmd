# Introduction

## What's This about?

::: {.incremental}

* End to end credential development, issuance, verfification
* Use [VC Data Model 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0), [JSON-LD 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11) for credential design
* Use [VC Data Integrity 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity) and Specific Cryptosuites to secure, issue and verify
* Use appropriate DIDs for development and deployment

:::

## Beyond Test Vectors

* All VC DI crypto suites include test vectors
* [VC-DI-EdDSA 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa) includes `eddsa-rdfc-2022` and `eddsa-jcs-2022` suites and has simple and enhanced test vectors as well as test vectors for proof sets and chains.
* [VC-DI-ECDSA 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa) includes `ecdsa-rdfc-2019`, `ecdsa-jcs-2019`, and `ecdsa-sd-2023` over curves P-256 and P-384 and test vectors.

## Beyond Sample Code and Sample Server

* [EdDSA/ECDSA Test Vectors](https://github.com/Wind4Greg/EdDSA-Test-Vectors) Code used to generate the test vectors (example secured credentials) in the [Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0](https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-eddsa/) and [Data Integrity ECDSA Cryptosuites v1.0](https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-ecdsa/)
* [ECDSA-SD and BBS Test Vectors](https://github.com/Wind4Greg/ECDSA-SD-TestVectors) Code used to generate the test vectors (example secured credentials) in the [Data Integrity ECDSA selective disclosure](https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-ecdsa/) and [Data Integrity BBS Cryptosuites v1.0](https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-bbs/)
* [ECDSA-SD Library](https://github.com/Wind4Greg/ECDSA-SD-Library), [BBS for VC Library](https://github.com/Wind4Greg/BBS-VC-Library)
* [Server for Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/Wind4Greg/Server-for-VCs) An example server for issuing and verifying *verifiable credential*. Used to participate in W3C interoperability tests.

## An Example Application of VCs

* Non-governmental
* Non-profit
* Small enough for student implementation

# Application: School or Community Club

## A 3rd Semester of Web Development?

::: {.incremental}

1. Basic front end and back end development [Introduction to full stack web development](https://www.grotto-networking.com/WebsiteDevelopment/WebDev.html)
2. More elaborate access control, security, and validation [Web Systems](https://www.grotto-networking.com/WebSystems/WebSystems.html), [Cybersecurity: An Overview](https://www.grotto-networking.com/CyberSecurity/CyberSec.html)
3. **Design verifiable credentials, issue and provide for their verification**
